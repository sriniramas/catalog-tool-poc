     * * `message` is message for notification to display

     * * `smart`, set to `true` if you want to use smart notification.
     *
     * **Example:**
     * ```typescript
     * // Info notification, saying "Sample message." added to the element with id notification-container
     * // uses smart timeout with added duration of 1 second.
     * {
     *	type: "info",
