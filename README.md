# catalog-tool-poc
This project is for the DEV team to get up to speed with using Carbon widget library and develop some sample UI pages in Angular 6/7. The application is a tool for WebSphere Commerce.

Tool chosen is the Catalog tool. As a first, the following are being developed - 
1. New Master Category
2. ExtendedSitesCatalogAssetStore
3. Header and Footer for the pages that will be displayed

This exercise attempts to address the following:
1. The use of IBM's Carbon widget library to render UI elements such as text boxes, radio buttons and so on
2. Creating and using a Github based repository
3. Develop to the SPA (Single Page Application) framework/guidelines
4. Focus on automation of unit and functional test cases
5. Focus on re-use of existing Carbon widgets - no new components/widgets to be created
